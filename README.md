## Set Up
NPM and bower have to be installed in order to set up the project.

## Adding a new library
When installing a new library with bower or npm, add it to the array in the gulp task `build-index` and also in respective task `move-bower-components`or `move-node-modules`.
The gulp file is located in the root of the project.

## Build & development
For running the app use `gulp run` this will run the following tasks:
* `clean-less`
* `less`
* `build-index`
* `review`
* `grunt-serve`

This will generate a general file to handle the css, which is located in app -> assets -> styles -> gash.css

## Adding new library
Whe adding new library with either npm or bower use the `--save` or `--save-dev` option.
Also add the new file's path to the gulp task `build-index` in the sources array specifically.
Then run the following command to inject those files into the index `gulp build-index`

## Testing
Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
